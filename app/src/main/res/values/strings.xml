    //What is Chit yog
    <string name="chit_yog">\u2022 Chit Yog Sadhana is a process to understand why and how we suffer from various imbalances at every level; physical, mental and emotional.\n\n
\u2022 Chit Yog Sadhana tells us that whenever one is dis-connected from their Chit, problems will come their way.\n\n
\u2022 Chit Yog Sadhana is a pathway to connect to your pure consciousness to overcome one’s ailments at all levels; physical, mental and emotional.\n\n
\u2022 Chit Yog Sadhana is for those who have tried various methods to overcome their issues, such as anxiety, stress, depression, panic attacks, paranoia, jealousy and hatred, either by:\n
       \t\t\t \u25BA Working in the gym;\n

       \t\t\t \u25BA Following various diet;\n

       \t\t\t \u25BA Following various meditation techniques.\n\n
\u2022 Chit Yog Sadhana is based on ancient wisdom and time-tested methods that prove that until a complete approach of purification is followed, coverings from our Chit will not be removed and we will stay dis-connected and keep suffering at every level.\n\n
\u2022 Chit Yog Sadhana helps in all kinds of issues such as depression, anxiety stress, panic attacks, paranoia jealousy, hatred and physical problems\n\n
\u2022 Chit Yog Sadhana empowers an individual to overcome their problems with their own efforts, rather than seeking help or guidance from others or looking to mask their symptoms with pills or potions.\n\n
\u2022 Chit Yog Sadhana helps an individual remove the root cause of their suffering, layer by layer, by following simple, practical routines in their day to day life so they can enjoy the benefits of their own awareness.\n\n
\u2022 Chit Yog Sadhana is path of action\n</string>


    //what is chit
    <string name="chit">\u2022 Chit is our true self.\n\n
\u2022 It is our pure consciousness.\n\n
\u2022 Chit is one’s identity.\n\n
\u2022 Chit caries all the memories that impact on our actions, thoughts and deeds.\n\n
\u2022 Chit is our true awareness.\n\n
\u2022 Chit is our protection from all sorts of problems; physical, mental or
emotional.\n\n
As long as one is connected to his/her Chit, they are protected and able to keep themselves away from any physical, mental and emotional problems. The moment one gets dis-connected from their Chit, problems start building.\n\n
This dis-connection starts when we make wrong choices through our actions, deeds and thoughts. These wrong choices create a covering over our Chit, dis-connection us from our true self.\n\n</string>

    //Level one intro
    <string name="one_intro">The first stage of Chit Yog Sadhana is various routines to cleanse the system and build the foundation for the next stage. Each action of this stage will strengthen every individual to take up the next part of the journey, where one will burn the layers covering their Chit and make their way through the darkness of mental and emotional problems to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
\n\nYou will follow these daily regimes for 30 days.</string>
    <string name="step1_1">1. Get up early</string>
    <string name="step1_1_detail">It is advisable for you wake up between 5.00 – 5.30 am as this time is considered as pure consciousness time (Brahma Muhurta). In Vedic philosophy, it is said that from 3.30am till sunrise one has more ability to connect with their Chit as the coverings are less potent during this period and one’s Chit has the natural ability to move upwards towards its source.
\nAt this time, the qualities of the environment are pure, calm, clear and vibrant so one’s mind is calm, clear and stable and has the ability to connect with the body easily.
\nOn physical level waking up during this period provides more clarity, stability in thoughts.</string>
    <string name="step1_2">2. Brush your teeth and scrape your tongue</string>
    <string name="step1_2_detail">Those who are dis-connected from their Chit or have lots of covering on their Chit will find their tongues will always have a coating in the morning when they wake up.
\nThe colour of the coating will be based on the type of emotions one suffers from. Those suffering from anxiety, worries, fear will have light white, brown coating on their tongue. Those suffering from anger, frustration, jealously, hatred, stress will have a coating of white-yellow colour. Those suffering from depression, possessiveness, greed, sadness will have white thick costing on their tongue.
\nIf one does not remove this coating within 3 minutes of waking up the coating will be re-absorbed and create more coating on their Chit. Hence it is advisable to brush teeth and scrape tongue within 3 minutes of getting up.</string>
    <string name="step_1_3">3. Make a morning de-tox drink</string>
    <string name="step_1_3_detail">Make a drink first thing in the morning. To a glass of warm water add,\n
\u2022 ½ teaspoon of grated ginger\n
\u2022 ½ teaspoon of honey\n
\u2022 ½ teaspoon of lemon juice\n
\nThis helps to flush the toxins from the gut before they get re-absorbed. Those who suffer from various emotions will always has a build-up of toxins in their gut and this helps to flush them out. If not, these toxins ultimately create another covering on their Chit and a stronger dis-connection from their Chit.</string>
    <string name="step_1_4">4. Nasya (nasal drops)</string>
    <string name="step_1_4_detail">Everyone should put three drops of warm, cold pressed black sesame oil in each nostril and massage around the eyes and nose three times.
\nThose who are dis-connected from their Chit always tend to experience a lack of enthusiasm or lack of cheerfulness. Sometime don’t feel like talking to anyone or get irritated and impatient easily. They tend to get angry or frustrated very easily.
\nThese drops help to counter these emotions and help to remove the covering from their Chit.</string>
    <string name="step_1_5">5. Avoid hot showers</string>
    <string name="step_1_5_detail">Those who are dis-connected from their Chit always like hot showers. The more dis-connected, the hotter the shower but this can be counter-productive. This heat affects the pituitary and pineal glands which impacts on the secretion of serotonin, making a person feel dull, heavy and lacking in enthusiasm.
\nTo know if your shower is too hot, check if the steam rises above your head. If it does, it is too hot. Also, when you finish the shower, if you have red/pink skin, the shower was too hot.</string>
    <string name="step_1_6">6. Self-massage with warm oil</string>
    <string name="step_1_6_detail">Those suffering from emotions such as anxiety, worries, fear, confusion will always have stiff and tight bodies, their hand and feet will always be cold and their skin dry.
\nThose suffering from anger, frustration, jealously hatred their bodies will always be hot with skin rashes and boils.
\nThose suffering from greed, passiveness, depression, suicidal thoughts will always have sluggish lymphatic system their bodies will have a natural tendency to hold water. This also stagnates your energy flow.
\nAll these are a sign of how you are dis-connected from your Chit.
\nEvery morning, before your shower, one should massage their body with warmed, cold-pressed black sesame oil in upward circular motion. It helps to improve lymphatic and circulation systems and flush toxins from lymphatic system and improve the immune system. This massage also makes bodily energy flow more rhythmically. </string>
    <string name="step_1_7">7. Deep breathing</string>
    <string name="step_1_7_detail">Shallow breathing is an indicator you are dis-connected from your Chit.
\nEveryone must take 10-15 long, deep, slow breaths through the nose three times a day. This helps to provide fresh prana to one’s body which brings more vitality, vigour and ability connect to one’s Chit.</string>
    <string name="step_1_8">8. Morning and evening walk</string>
    <string name="step_1_8_detail">One must go for a 30 minute walk every day around 6.00am. and again at 6.00 pm This helps to bring more vitality, vigour and alertness. It loosens the body, improves circulation, bring more groundedness and stablises the immune system.
\nUntil or unless one is physically and mentally strong and stable one cannot make effort to connect with his/her Chit.</string>

    //Level three intro
    <string name="three_intro">
        The phrase, “We are what we eat” is not just about what you eat but also includes how you eat as this also impacts on Chit, particularly things like:\n\n
\u2022 Technology\n
\u2022 Surroundings\n
\u2022 Our ways to eat\n
\u2022 Our thoughts at time of eating
\n\nThese factors are responsible for either creating more covering on our Chit and taking us further away from our Chit or helping us remove these coverings to connect us with our Chit and give us inner peace and wellness that lasts.
To achieve this:\n\n
\u2022 Don’t eat your meal while watching TV\n
\u2022 Don’t eat while talking\n
\u2022 Don’t eat when emotionally upset\n
\u2022 Don’t eat on the run\n
\u2022 Don’t eat and drink together\n
\u2022 Don’t eat while on phone\n
\u2022 Don’t eat while playing on computers\n
\u2022 Don’t cook when emotionally upset, either sad, anxious or stressed, angry or frustrated\n
\u2022 Don’t have bad thoughts while eating\n
\u2022 Don’t just eat to fill your tummy\n
\u2022 Never eat food when standing. Must sit while eating.\n

    //Level four intro
    <string name="four_intro">
        This stage is key to your wellness. One wonders I did everything in my life to overcome my problems:\n\n
\u2022 I follow the advice of my medical professionals\n
\u2022 I follow the advice of my religious guru\n
\u2022 Gone to religious place every day\n
\u2022 Made lots of changes to my diet\n
\u2022 Meditate for 1 hour every day\n
\u2022 Have become a vegan\n
\u2022 Chant mantras every day\n
\u2022 Wear sandalwood paste on my forehead\n
\u2022 Followed daily routines to improve my lifestyle\n
\nBut still my mental and emotional issues affect me.\n\n
Chit Yog Sadhana advises us superficial changes never help to take the covering off from our Chit alone with above unless out thoughts, our deeds, our interactions with others improve and get better. Our control of our desires, our control of our senses all impact on our mind and lead mind to make mistakes, make wrong choices, perceive things around us differently.
\n\nChit Yog Sadhana as this level helps one to identify are we slave of our mind or are we master of our mind? Be master of your mind and take the covering off your Chit.
\n\nChit Yog Sadhana helps is to achieve this in two steps:\n
    </string>

    //Level four sub intro
    <string name="four_step_1">We all understand that our thoughts become our emotions and our emotions lead to our actions, which can either create a covering on our Chit or help to remove it, depending on the nature of the deed. Therefore, it is important to process these thoughts and emotions on a daily basis because if we don’t, they can create more coverings to our Chit.
\n\nWhen one goes to sleep and enters a sub-conscious state, these emotions become active. According to the qualities of these emotions, they leave an imprint on our body and nervous system. For example, if one has un-processed emotions of anxiety and worry, they can impact the body in this form. The result of this situation is that despite a person having 8 -10 hours’ sleep, rather than being in a state of relaxation, our body and nervous system remain in an active mode, so we wake up feeling exhausted and fatigued rather than rested and calm. We are all aware that sleep is when the body repairs itself from the wear and tear of daily living. If our body is in an active state during this time, the repair work does not take place, and slowly the body’s immune system can become affected.
\n\nTo prevent this process, it is very important that we process our thoughts on a daily basis. No matter how busy you are, before going to bed sit for 10 minutes to review the day. Close your eyes and ask yourself:
\u2022 Did I get angry today?\n
\u2022 Did I get jealous with someone?\n
\u2022 Did I have feelings of hatred today?\n
\u2022 Did I get frustrated today?\n
\u2022 Did I cheat on someone today?\n
\u2022 Did I steal anything today?\n
\u2022 Did I get nervous today?\n
\u2022 Have I spoke a lie today?\n
\u2022 Have I done anything which I am not supposed to do?\n
\u2022 Have I said something to my parents that could be hurtful?\n
\u2022 As I upset with my children today?\n
\u2022 Did I treat my employees badly today?\n
\u2022 Have I dealt with my work colleagues wrongly?\n\n
If the answer to any of the above if ‘Yes”
\u2022 Identify what was it\n
\u2022 Why it happened\n
\u2022 How I can avoid it\n
\u2022 How can I improve it for tomorrow?\n\n
Continue this practice for 15 days.</string>

    //Level four sub intro 2
    <string name="four_step_2">\u2022 Each evening, before bed, stand in front of a mirror\n
\u2022 Look into to your eyes\n
\u2022 Place you hand on you heart and ask yourself, “Have I done anything wrong today?\n
\u2022 Keep repeating this question for 5 minutes, looking into your eyes the whole time\n
\u2022 During this time, if you have to look away from your reflection (even for 1 second), stop the practice and sit quietly for 10 minutes.\n
\u2022 Ask yourself what thoughts came up that made you look away. Were you remembering thoughts and actions that occurred during the day that made you uncomfortable? If so, make a commitment to yourself, to your Chit, not to repeat these thoughts and actions tomorrow. If you realise you have reacted the wrong way in a situation, identify it and make a commitment to amend your behaviour for next time. Also, make a commitment to apologise to anyone you may have hurt next time you see them.\n
\u2022 Repeat this process every night until you are able to look into the mirror for the full five minutes without looking away.\n
\nThose who can do this on a daily basis can rest assured that though they might suffer from some physical problem in their life, they will never ever suffer from any mental ailments.\n
\nWhen ready, you can move onto the next stage</string>

    <string name="intro_two">There is a saying, “We are what we eat”. Our thoughts and actions are influenced by the food we eat so we need to minimise the intake of foods which can cause more covering to our Chit. When we are dis-connected from our Chit we begin to make wrong choices we have to take wrong decisions which leads to do such activity which can build another layer on our Chit.
\n\nFor the next 30 days, avoid eating the following foods:
\n\nFrozen food:
        \n\t\tFrozen food is considered more dull, heavy and difficult to digest. This food has natural tendency to make one’s mind duller heavy and cloudy which makes it difficult for one to work to re-connect to their Chit and connect with it hence it is advisable to avoid all frozen food
        \n\nTinned food:
        \n\t\tThis food also lacks prana life force which is very essential to make connections with Chit. Hence those who have dis-connected from Chit always naturally go towards liking tinned foods but those seeking to connect with Chit should avoid eating tinned food
        \n\nProcessed food:
        \n\t\tStimulating – Creates more disharmony with Chit
        \n\nMicrowaved food:
        \n\t\tLacks Prana – Creates confusion with Chit
        \n\nWhite bread:
        \n\t\tHeavy, dull, sticky -  Creates heaviness and dullness, lack of energ.
        \n\nCoffee:
        \n\t\tStimulating – Creates more dis-harmony. Burns Prana
        \n\nPeanut Butter:
        \n\t\tHeavy, oily - Creates more disharmony with Chit
        \n\nChilli:
        \n\t\tHot: Creates more disharmony with Chit. Burns Prana
        \n\nWhite sugar:
        \n\t\tBring more aggravation
        \n\nTomato sauce:
        \n\t\tAcidic, heavy; Disharmony with Chit. Burns Prana
        \n\nAlcohol:
        \n\t\tStimulating. Disconnect with Chit lead to making wrong choices
        \n\nMarijuana:
        \n\t\tMind altering. Disconnect with Chit
        \n\nRecreational drugs:
        \n\t\tBuild more covering on Chit by making wrong choices
        \n\nPre-cooked foods:
        \n\t\tCloudy, heavy and dull
        \n\nRed meat:
        \n\t\tHeavy, dull, cloudy and dead food (lacks Prana). Adds more layers
        \n\nChilli sauce:
        \n\t\tStimulating
