    //What is Chit yog
    <string name="chit_yog">\u2022 Chit Yog Sadhana is a process to understand why and how we suffer from various imbalances at every level; physical, mental and emotional.\n\n

       \t\t\t \u25BA Following various meditation techniques.\n\n
\u2022 Chit Yog Sadhana is based on ancient wisdom and time-tested methods that prove that until a complete approach of purification is followed, coverings from our Chit will not be removed and we will stay dis-connected and keep suffering at every level.\n\n

    //what is chit
    <string name="chit">\u2022 Chit is our true self.\n\n
\u2022 It is our pure consciousness.\n\n
\u2022 Chit is one’s identity.\n\n
\u2022 Chit caries all the memories that impact on our actions, thoughts and deeds.\n\n
\u2022 Chit is our true awareness.\n\n
\u2022 Chit is our protection from all sorts of problems; physical, mental or
emotional.\n\n
As long as one is connected to his/her Chit, they are protected and able to keep themselves away from any physical, mental and emotional problems. The moment one gets dis-connected from their Chit, problems start building.\n\n
This dis-connection starts when we make wrong choices through our actions, deeds and thoughts. These wrong choices create a covering over our Chit, dis-connection us from our true self.\n\n</string>
